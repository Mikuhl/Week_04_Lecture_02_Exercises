List the five falsey values in JavaScript.
Falsy - false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN


List five truthy values in JavaScript.
All other values are truthy, including "0" (zero in quotes), "false" (false in quotes),
 empty functions, empty arrays, and empty objects.



Take a look at the code example below and state what the variable sameAge will be set to and explain why.

var myAge = 33;
var yourAge = "33";

var sameAge = (myAge === yourAge) ? "Yes!" : "No!";

Since === is a explicit comparison operator, the answer will be "No!" If the 
!== were used, it would Yes!
